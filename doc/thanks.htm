		I, Luc BRUANT aka fullmetalcoder, want to thanks all those who helped
		me in the last few years and without whom Edyuk wouldn't be what it is
		now.
		
		<h3>Team members, present and (mostly) past</h3>
		<ul>
	<li>Brian M Workman : joined the team around begining of spring 2007 if I
	remember well, (correct me if I'm wrong) and did important work on Edyuk
	configuration facilities for both dialog and core.</li>
	
	<li>Juergen P Messerer : joined the team around the end of spring 2007, bringing
	ideas and code samples along. His first contribution is the draggable tab bar.
	Although I completely changed the implementation he proposed the concept and
	the motivation comes from him.</li>
	
	<li> Christophe Duelli aka caduel : joined the team in august 2007 and started
	hacking right away after having submitted a very useful issues list.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Contributors</h3>
		<ul>
	<li> Elcuco ranted an incredible number of time but most of his opinions, though
	a bit acid hopefully lead to fixes and improvements</li>
	
	<li> Jeremy Magland did some really useful testings under Windows which allowed
	me to track down all bugs whitout having a windows box.</li>
	
	<li> Donaldinos and Jens Idelberger did some testing/debugging under Mac which
	allowed me to fix bugs encountered on this platform without having one to do
	the tests myself.</li>
	
	<li> Shriraman Sharma fed me back about all scripting issues. He gave me links and
	ideas that finally lead me to the shiny new build script.</li>
	
	<li> Kent Kristensen gave me a long wishlist for QCodeEdit 2 and you can already see
	some new features that come from there</li>
	
	<li> Thomas Keller provided a lot of useful feedback about Mac integration and UI
	design, and a couple of reworked ui files as well.</li>
	
	<li> Benito van der Zander is probably the most helpful tester. The vast amount of
	feedback that came from him accounts for many bugfixes and improvements in QCodeEdit
	(so in Edyuk as well).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Donors</h3>
		They prefered remaining anonymous but there generosity has not been forgotten.
		It allowed to buy a domain name (edyuk.org) and to buy a new laptop which
		significantly improved my productivity.
		
		<h3>Testers</h3>
		Without extensive testing and feedback I wouldn't have gone far.
		
		<h3>Other</h3>
		<ul>
	<li>Trolltech of course for their great framework, its awesome documentation and their open minded attitude towards OSS</li>
	<li>TuxFamily.org for their excellent free hosting services</li>
